# AES_Feedback_Cipher

## Project Specifications
This project is the result of the course Hardware and Embedded Security for the Cybersecurity Master Course at University of Pisa, academic year 2023-2024. The goal is to design, implement and test the Feedback Cipher (AES-Sbox based) schema. The project follows a FPGA design workflow, which sees the implementation of both the encryption and decryption functionalities of the cipher through System Ver ilog design files. These are then processed through the Modelsim software to observe the cipher’s behavior on a zero-delay simulation. As a last step, the design is loaded onto Quartus Prime to carry out the Logic Synthesis, Fitting and Static Timing Analysis phases. The project also oultines an high-level representation of the logic’s of the cipher, which is presented in Python.
